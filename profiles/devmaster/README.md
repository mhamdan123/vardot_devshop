DevShop DevMaster
=================

This is the DevShop web-based front-end, called Devmaster.

The stable branch, 0.x is a Drupal 6 Distribution.
The next branch, 1.x is a Drupal distribution.  It is mostly working, and will see a release soon.

This project should not be used on it's own.  The main devshop project
installer will use this install profile as a part of the setup process.
